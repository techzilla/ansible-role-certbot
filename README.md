# Ansible Role: certbot
| A role to install certbot and create SSL certificates via letsencrypt.org

- installs certbot
- creates certificates for given domains
- will stop/start daemons

This role does _not_ cover opening firewall ports for the handshake. Currently only  `create_method = standalone` and `renew_method = cron` are covered, but the role is prepared for implementation of other methods in the future.

## Disclaimer

Due to some major issues, currently `create_challenge = tls-sni` is not supported from letsencrypt.org.

## Motivation

[Certbot](https://certbot.eff.org/) is a tool to issue SSL/TLS certificates from [letsencrypt.org](https://letsencrypt.org/). Having a SSL/TLS certificate is a one of the major things to consider for any Webserver. With letsencrypt you will get one free.

```
ansible-galaxy install -r requirements.yml
```

## Role Variables

Below you can find all variables used. You need to set some of the variables manually.

Mandatory Variables:

You must set a valid contact.
```
wtd_certbot_create_contact: "your@email.address.here"
```
You must configure daemons, which may use the ports already.
```
wtd_certbot_create_stop_daemons: ["httpd"]
```
You should configure domains, which should be created. Default is the inventory Hostname.
```
wtd_certbot_create_domains: ["foo.domain.com","bar.domain.com"]
```

Default Variables:

```yaml
---
# defaults/main.yml for certbot
#
# You can set the state to ["present"|"absent"|"latest"]
wtd_certbot_state: "present"
wtd_certbot_packages: ["certbot"]

# Here you can define, if/how a certificate is created
wtd_certbot_create: True
wtd_certbot_create_method: "standalone"
wtd_certbot_create_domains: ["{{ inventory_hostname }}"]
# You have to provide a valid mail address
wtd_certbot_create_contact: ""

# Currently only tls-sni and http are supported.
# You have to assure that the firewall port is openend.
# http = 80/tcp, tls-sni = 443/tcp.
wtd_certbot_create_challenges: "http"

# Standalone Method needs a port to create a cert.
# Therefore all other daemons, which may use this
# port must be stopped during creation.
wtd_certbot_create_stop_daemons: []

# Here you have to define, if/how the renewal will happen
# According to letsencrypt, 2 times a day is a good idea.
wtd_certbot_renew: True
wtd_certbot_renew_method: "cron"
wtd_certbot_renew_hour: "0,12"
wtd_certbot_renew_minute: 0
```

## Example Playbook

Simple Example:

```yaml
- hosts: servers
  roles:
    - { role: while_true_do.certbot, wtd_certbot_create_contact: me@cool.org }
```

## Testing
